OCDS Merge
==========

|PyPI Version| |Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Python Version|

This Python package helps to create records that conform to the `Open Contracting Data Standard <https://standard.open-contracting.org>`__. Specifically, it provides functions for merging OCDS releases with the same OCID into either a compiled release or a versioned release, as described in the `OCDS documentation <https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/merging/>`__.

::

   pip install ocdsmerge

Usage
-----

The two main functions are :code:`merge` and :code:`merge_versioned`. They take OCDS releases as input, and return a compiled release or a versioned release as output, respectively. For example:

.. code:: python

   import ocdsmerge

   # In a real-world example, the OCDS releases might be loaded from JSON files.
   releases = [
       {
           "ocid": "ocds-213czf-A",
           "id": "1",
           "date": "2014-01-01",
           "tag": ["tender"],
           "initiationType": "tender",
           "tender": {
               "id": "A",
               "procurementMethod": "selective"
           }
       },
       {
           "ocid": "ocds-213czf-A",
           "id": "2",
           "date": "2014-01-02",
           "tag": ["tender"],
           "initiationType": "tender",
           "tender": {
               "id": "A",
               "procurementMethod": "open"
           }
       }
   ]

   compiledRelease = ocdsmerge.merge(releases)

   versionedRelease = ocdsmerge.merge_versioned(releases)

You can then create an OCDS record using the :code:`compiledRelease` and :code:`versionedRelease`.

Important caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You must ensure that the OCDS releases that you provide as input have the same OCID.
-  If you are using an older version of the OCDS release schema, you must specify the older schema as a URL, file path, or Python dictionary (see below).
-  If you are using OCDS extensions, you should patch the OCDS release schema (for instance, using `json-merge-patch <https://pypi.org/project/json-merge-patch/>`__) and specify the patched schema as a URL, file path, or Python dictionary.

Using different release schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :code:`merge` and :code:`merge_versioned` functions use the latest version of the OCDS release schema, which they download once. However, you may want to use an older version, an extended schema, or a local schema to avoid remote requests. To do so, use the optional :code:`schema` argument, which can be:

-  A URL to a release schema, as a string starting with ``http``
-  A file path to a release schema, as a string
-  a release schema, as a Python dictionary

.. code:: python

   # URL
   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, schema='https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__0__3/release-schema.json')

   # Relative file path
   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, schema='release-schema.json')

   # Absolute file path
   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, schema='/absolute/path/to/release-schema.json')

   # A Python dictionary, stored in a `release_schema` variable
   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, schema=release_schema)

Using cached merge rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`merge` and :code:`merge_versioned` functions extract merge rules from the release schema. If the release schema were provided as a string (i.e. as a URL or file path), then these merge rules are automatically cached between function calls. However, if it were provided as a Python dictionary, then they won't be cached. To manually cache merge rules, use the :code:`get_merge_rules` function:

.. code:: python

   merge_rules = ocdsmerge.get_merge_rules('release-schema.json')

   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, merge_rules=merge_rules)

Working with degenerate data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The merge routine merges multiple individual releases into either a compiled release or a versioned release. Across the individual releases, it merges objects in arrays based on their ``id`` values, as described in the `OCDS documentation <https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/merging/>`__. This allows a publisher to, for example, disclose an upcoming milestone in one release, and set the date on which it was met in another release.

However, if objects that correspond to different things re-use ``id`` values, then only the last object is retained in the merged release, by default. (To be clear, such data has structural errors.) For example, if a publisher creates a release for each award notice in a procurement procedure, and restarts the numbering of award objects in each release from '1', then the later releases will overwrite the award objects of the earlier releases.

Similarly, if, in a single release, objects in the same array share an ``id`` value, then only the last object is retained.

If, in a single release, objects in the same array share an ``id`` value, the :code:`merge` and :code:`merge_versioned` functions issue a :code:`DuplicateIdValueWarning` warning. You can turn the warning into an exception or ignore the warning using a `warning filter <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/warnings.html>`__. For example:

.. code:: python

   import warnings

   import ocdsmerge
   from ocdsmerge.merge import DuplicateIdValueWarning

   # Raise an error, instead.
   with warnings.catch_warnings():
       warnings.filterwarnings('error', category=DuplicateIdValueWarning)
       ocdsmerge.merge(releases)

   # Ignore the warning, instead.
   with warnings.catch_warnings():
       warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DuplicateIdValueWarning)
       ocdsmerge.merge(releases)

If you know in advance that the individual releases have structure errors as described above, you can change the behavior of the merge routine by setting the :code:`rule_overrides` argument on a per-field basis:

-  :code:`ocdsmerge.MERGE_BY_POSITION`: merge objects in the given array based on their array index, instead of their ``id`` value.

   - This is appropriate if the publisher always re-publishes all prior objects in a given array, and puts them in a consistent order.

-  :code:`ocdsmerge.APPEND`: retain all objects in the given array, instead of merging any.

   - This is appropriate if the publisher never updates or re-publishes a prior object in a given array.

The field paths are specified as tuples. For example:

.. code:: python

   ocdsmerge.merge(releases, rule_overrides={
       ('awards',): ocdsmerge.APPEND,
       ('contracts', 'implementation', 'milestones'): ocdsmerge.MERGE_BY_POSITION,
   })

Reference implementation
------------------------

This package serves as a reference implementation of OCDS merging. You can read its commented code in `merge.py <https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-merge/blob/master/ocdsmerge/merge.py>`__.

Test cases
~~~~~~~~~~

We provide test cases for other implementations of OCDS merging under the `tests/fixtures <https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-merge/tree/master/tests/fixtures>`__ directory. The ``1.0`` and ``1.1`` directories contain files like ``simple.json``, which contain a list of OCDS releases as JSON; the suffixed ``simple-compiled.json`` and ``simple-versioned.json`` files contain the expected compiled release and versioned release respectively. To test your implementation, provide as input a file like ``simple.json`` as well as the appropriate version of the OCDS release schema, and compare your output to files like ``simple-compiled.json`` and ``simple-versioned.json``.

To prepare your implementation for future versions and third-party extensions, you can test your implementation using the files under the ``schema`` directory and using the schema in the `schema.json <https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-merge/blob/master/tests/fixtures/schema.json>`__ file.

In future, we can consider providing a more formal test suite, like those for `CSV on the Web <http://w3c.github.io/csvw/tests/>`__. Please contact data@open-contracting.org if interested.
